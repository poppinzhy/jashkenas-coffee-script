This folder includes rough cuts of CoffeeScript syntax highlighters for 
TextMate and Vim. Improvements to their lexing ability are always welcome.

To install the TextMate bundle, drop it into:
  ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles

To install the Vim highlighter, copy "coffee.vim" into the "syntax" directory of
your vim72, and enable it in either of the following two ways:

  * Manually, by running `:set syntax=coffee`
  
  * Or automatically, by creating a "filetype.vim" file within "~/.vim", which
    contains something along these lines:
    
    if exists("did_load_filetypes")
      finish
    end
    augroup filetypedetect
      au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.coffee setfiletype coffee
    augroup END
